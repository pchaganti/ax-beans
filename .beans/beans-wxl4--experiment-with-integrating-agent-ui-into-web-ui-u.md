Explore integrating an agent UI into the beans web interface using the Agent Client Protocol (ACP).

## Context

ACP (Agent Client Protocol) is a protocol designed for building agent UIs. See: https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/introduction

## Goals

- Research ACP and understand its capabilities
- Evaluate how it could be used to add an agentic interface to the beans web UI
- Prototype a basic integration

## Checklist

- [ ] Review ACP documentation and understand the protocol
- [ ] Identify what agent capabilities would be useful in beans (e.g., natural language bean creation, querying, updates)
- [ ] Design how the agent UI would integrate with existing web UI
- [ ] Implement a proof-of-concept integration
- [ ] Document findings and next steps
