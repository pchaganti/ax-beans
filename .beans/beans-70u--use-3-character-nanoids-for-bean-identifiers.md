title: Use 3-character NanoIDs for bean identifiers
status: done
---


Bean IDs should use 3-character NanoIDs instead of longer strings. This keeps filenames short and human-friendly while still being mergeable across branches. Currently IDs are 8 characters (e.g., 'xzrbia9l'), but they should be 3 characters (e.g., 'f7g').
