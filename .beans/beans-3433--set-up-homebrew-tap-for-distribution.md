## Summary

Allow users to install beans via Homebrew by setting up a tap repository and configuring goreleaser to auto-publish formulas.

## Steps

### 1. Create Homebrew Tap Repository

Create a new GitHub repo named `homebrew-beans` (the `homebrew-` prefix enables the shorthand `brew install hmans/beans/beans`).

### 2. Add `brews` Section to `.goreleaser.yaml`

```yaml
brews:
  - repository:
      owner: hmans
      name: homebrew-beans
    homepage: "https://github.com/hmans/beans"
    description: "Agentic-first issue tracker"
    license: "MIT"  # adjust as needed
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Token

Ensure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` used in CI has write access to the tap repository.

### 4. Test Release

Run a release and verify the formula is pushed to the tap repo.
