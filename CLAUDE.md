# What we're building

You already know what beans is. This is the beans repository.

# Work Parallelization

We're aiming to parallelize multiple agents. To this end, please follow these rules:

- Create a git worktree for each agent working on a bean. This way, each agent has its own isolated working directory.
- Mark the bean as "in-progress" in the main worktree when an agent starts working on it. This prevents multiple agents from working on the same bean simultaneously.
- Once the agent completes the bean, mark it as "completed" in the main worktree.

# Commits

- Use conventional commit messages ("feat", "fix", "chore", etc.) when making commits.
- Mark commits as "breaking" using the `!` notation when applicable (e.g., `feat!: ...`).
- When making commits, provide a meaningful commit message. The description should be a concise bullet point list of changes made.

# Pull Requests

- When we're working in a PR branch, make separate commits, and update the PR description to reflect the changes made.

# Project Specific

- When making changes to the GraphQL schema, run `mise codegen` to regenerate the code.
- The `internal/graph/` package provides a GraphQL resolver that can be used to query and mutate beans.
- All CLI commands that interact with beans should internally use GraphQL queries/mutations.
- `mise build` to build a `./beans` executable

# Extra rules for our own beans/issues

- Use the `idea` tag for ideas and proposals.

# Testing

## Unit Tests

- Always write or update tests for the changes you make.
- Run all tests: `go test ./...`
- Run specific package: `go test ./internal/bean/`
- Verbose output: `go test -v ./...`
- Use table-driven tests following Go conventions

## Manual CLI Testing

- Use `go run .` instead of building the executable first.
- When testing read-only functionality, feel free to use this project's own `.beans/` directory. But for anything that modifies data, create a separate test project directory. All commands support the `--beans-path` flag to specify a custom path.
