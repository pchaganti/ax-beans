**Beans is an issue tracker for you, your team, and your coding agents.** Instead of tracking tasks in a separate application, Beans stores them right alongside your code. You can use the `beans` CLI to interact with your tasks, but more importantly, so can your favorite coding agent!

This gives your robot friends a juicy upgrade: now they get a complete view of your project, make suggestions for what to work on next, track their progress, create bug issues for problems they find, and more.

You've been programming all your life; now you get to be a product manager. Let's go! 🚀

## Features

- Track tasks, bugs, features, and more right alongside your code.
- Plain old Markdown files stored in a `.beans` directory in your project. Easy to version control, readable and editable by humans and machines alike!
- Use the `beans` CLI to create, list, view, update, and archive beans; but more importantly, let your coding agent do it for you!
- Supercharge your robot friend with full context about your project and its open tasks. A built-in GraphQL query engine allows your agent to get exactly the information it needs, keeping token use to a minimum.
- A beautiful built-in TUI for browsing and managing your beans from the terminal.
- Generates a Markdown roadmap document for your project from your data.

## Installation

Either download Beans from the [Releases section](https://github.com/hmans/beans/releases), or install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install hmans/beans/beans
```

Alternatively, install directly via Go:

```bash
go install github.com/hmans/beans@latest
```

## Setup

Now initialize Beans in your project:

```bash
beans init
```

This will create a `.beans/` directory in your project and a `.beans.yml` configuration file at the project root. Everything is meant to be tracked in your version control system.

You can interact with your Beans through the `beans` CLI. To get a list of available commands:

```bash
beans help
```

But more importantly, you'll want to get your coding agent set up to use it. Let's dive in!

## Agent Configuration

We'll need to teach your coding agent that it should use Beans to track tasks, and how to do so. The exact steps will depend on which agent you're using.

### Claude Code

An official Beans plugin for Claude is in the works, but for the time being, please manually add the following hooks to your project's `.claude/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "beans prime" }] }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "beans prime" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Other Agents

You can use Beans with other coding agents by configuring them to run `beans prime` to get the prompt instructions for task management. We'll add specific integrations for popular agents over time.

## Usage

Assuming you have integrated Beans into your coding agent correctly, it will already know how to create and manage beans for you. You can use the usual assortment of natural language inquiries. If you've just
added Beans to an existing project, you could try asking your agent to identify potential tasks and create beans for them:

> "Are there any tasks we should be tracking for this project? If so, please create beans for them."

If you already have some beans available, you can ask your agent to recommend what to work on next:

> "What should we work on next?"

You can also specifically ask it to start working on a particular bean:

> "It's time to tackle myproj-123."

## Contributing

This project currently does not accept contributions -- it's just way too early for that!
But if you do have suggestions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue.
